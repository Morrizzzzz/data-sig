## Bring your own data challenges

Do you have a data handling issue? You can bring your issue to the SIG -- we can look at the issue together and do our best to help you find the most suitable solution.

### What do you need?

 - Open an issue on github and label it `help wanted`.
 - Describe the type of issue you want to address. Make sure to include:
    - What is your final goal ?
    - What is the challenge ?
    - A sample of your data (if possible).
    - Which technologies you are using to store and access the data.

We will discuss your issue during the next SIG meeting.

## Share your data solutions

Did you do something really cool with your data ? Share your experiences with the SIG! Contact Arnold or Carlos and they will add you to the list of upcoming sessions.

Possible things you might like to share:
 - Tools & Methodologies for storage
 - Tools & Methodologies for access
 - Data FAIRness
 - Data handling
